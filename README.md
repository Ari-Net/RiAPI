# RiAPI

Here 3 tests on C# (RestSharp) with:
* Upload
* GetFileMetadata
* Delete file
Also a Postman collection, where I wrote requests.

You need to have next packages to run:

|Id                  |Versions  |
|--------------------|----------|
|MSTest.TestAdapter  |{2.1.1}   |
|MSTest.TestFramework|{2.1.1}   |
|NUnit               |{3.12.0}  | 
|NUnit3TestAdapter   |{3.17.0}  |
